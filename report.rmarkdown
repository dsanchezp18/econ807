This document goes through my code and output done to answer question 2 (ECON)

# Preliminaries

Below, I load the libraries which I will need for doing the assignment.

# Question 2 (a): Investment/GDP & Per-person GDP

To answer this question, I will use data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, which is a lot of data at the country level since 1960. I will extract the data from the World Bank's API by using the marvelous package [**WDI**](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI) from [Vincent Arel-Bundock](https://arelbundock.com/). I load the data below:


```{r}
#| label: load-data

# Create my vector of indicators that I want to use

indicators <- c(
  'NE.GDI.FTOT.ZS', #  Gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP)
  'NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD', # GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $)
  'NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD', # GDP, PPP (constant 2017 international $)'
  )

# Now get my data

wdi_raw <-
  WDI(indicator = indicators,
      end = 2021,
      extra = T)

```


I will use gross fixed capital formation as a % of GDP to proxy Investment/GDP, as according to the database's documentation, this variable "includes land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings" [-@wb_gcf].
